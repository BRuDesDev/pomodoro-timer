Some hold the 'Pomodoro' technique as "the secret to effective time management".
The technique is a method for staying focused and mentally fresh. As well as to beat procrastination.

www.todoist.com says this about the 'Pomodoro Technique':<br>
        <blockquote>The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.</blockquote><br><br>

**<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK</h3>**<br>
1. Pick a task
2. Start Pomodoro Timer<br>
_Work on your task for the 25 min. After 25 min the timer will tell you to take a 5 min break. Do that. _<br>
**<t>When the 5 min is up, you will be awarded a Check [‚úî] meaning you finished 1 Pomodoro.**<br>

This will repeat until you have completed 4 Pomodoro's, and EVERY 4 Pomodoros you will take a 20 min break.
